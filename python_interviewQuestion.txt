1) Difference between List and Tuple ?

LIST
* List is a Mutable object it can able to change after creation 
* here we are using square brackets []
* Lists are slightly slower than tuples
* List have many imbuild method such as (append, extend, sort )

TUPLE
* Tuple is a Immutable object we cannot modify it after creation 
* here we are using parentheses ()
* Tuples are slightly faster than lists
* tuple have few imbuild method such as (index , count)

List methods?
lst = [3, 1, 2]
lst.append(4)        # [3, 1, 2, 4]
lst.extend([5, 6])   # [3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
lst.insert(0, 9)     # [9, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
lst.remove(3)        # [9, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
item = lst.pop()     # item = 6, lst = [9, 1, 2, 4, 5]
lst.sort()           # [1, 2, 4, 5, 9]
lst.reverse()        # [9, 5, 4, 2, 1]
new = lst.copy()     # new = [9, 5, 4, 2, 1]

2) Difference between Dictionary and Set ?

DICTNORY
* key should be uinque
* it is working like Hashing
* syntax key colon value inside the curly braces

SET
* Set is a unorder collection
* All value should be uinque
* here also using curly braces


3) What are the Difference between == , is operator and in operator?

* "==" if check both value are equal.
* "is" if check both variable are located in same memory.
* "in" if check wheather a value exisit is inside the sequence of collection.


4)What is the difference between Flask, Django, and FastAPI?

* Django is a full-stack, batteries-included web framework, meaning it provides everything
out of the box such as ORM, authentication, admin panel, and templating. It is ideal for large, 
database-driven applications that follow the MVC pattern.

* Flask is a lightweight micro-framework, which provides only the core web routing features. 
Developers add extensions manually based on project needs. It gives more flexibility and is suitable
 for smaller services and APIs.

* FastAPI is a modern, high-performance framework designed for building APIs, especially 
asynchronous ones. It supports automatic validation and documentation using Pydantic and OpenAPI,
 and is often faster than Flask and Django for API workloads.


5)What is the perpose of Module and Package ?

* Module is a single python file, improve readblity to share code accorss the project 
* A package is a folder that contains multiple Module
* A Library in python is a collection of module and package 

7)How is memory managed in python ?

Python manages memory automatically using a private heap space. All Python objects are stored in this heap,
and memory allocation and deallocation are handled by the Python Memory Manager. 
Python also uses reference counting to track how many references point to an object. 
When an object’s reference count becomes zero, it becomes eligible for garbage collection, 
which frees the unused memory. So overall, Python supports automatic memory allocation and garbage 
collection.

8) what is the decorator?

A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function as input and adds extra functionality 
to it without modifying the original function’s code. Decorators are commonly used for cross-cutting 
concerns like logging, authentication, caching, and performance measurement.

9) what is the generator?

A generator in Python is a special type of function that returns values one at a time using the 
yield keyword instead of returning them all at once. Generators do not store the entire sequence 
in memory — they produce values lazily, only when needed — which makes them very memory-efficient for 
working with large data.

10) What is iter and what is an iterator in Python?

In Python, an iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through elements of a 
collection one at a time. An iterator must implement the __iter__() and __next__() methods.

The built-in iter() function is used to convert an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string)
into an iterator. Once you have an iterator, you can get the next value using the next() 
function until a StopIteration exception is raised.

11) what is Positional aurgument and keyword aurgument?

Positional aurgument are passed to function in the correct order the posisition mater because the funciton 
assign value based in where they appear

keyword aurgument are passed by explicitly naming the parameter so order does not mater,
 they also make code readablity  

12) what is the perpose of the self keyword?
SELF reperacent the instance of the class it is used to access instance variable and instance methods

13) What are __new__ and __init__ in Python?

__new__ is the method that create the object while __init__ the method that 
initlized the object after it has been created.

14)What is MRO (Method Resolution Order)?
MRO is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute when there are multiple inheritance classes.

15)What is the GIL, and how does threading work in Python?

GIL = Global interprenter lock, is a mutex in python that ensure only one thread execute 
    python byte code at a time, it is simply memory management, but it also means cpu bound python code 
    can't truly run in parallel across multiple cores using threads

16)What is Multithreading?
    one process (one program) with multiple threads inside It 
    Multithreading means running multiple threads inside the same process, sharing the same memory. 
    In Python it’s great for I/O-bound tasks, but CPU-bound code doesn’t gain real parallelism because of the GIL. 
    Multiprocessing creates separate processes, each with its own memory and Python interpreter, so it allows true
     parallel execution across CPU cores — making it better for CPU-bound workloads.

17)Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy?
    Shallow copy create a new object but it doesn't recusively copy the object inside it, it only copy the referance.
    Deep copy creates a completely independent copy of the object and everthing inside it.


18) what is authentication and Authorization?
    Authentication : 
        it is the process of verifing a user identity (Who you are)
    Authorization :
        it is this process deceiding what an authenticated user is permitted to access (what are you allowed to do )
